Roblox Extension Safety Suite (Beta)
A Chrome extension that scans installed browser extensions for Roblox‑related risks, suspicious permissions, and known scam patterns.
This project was created by Luz. The phrase “built by Roblox players” refers to the fact that many of the ideas, concerns, and patterns analyzed in this tool come from the wider Roblox community.

This project is currently in beta and may evolve as testing continues.
